                    <h1 class="uppercase font-bold mb-2">So, who am I?</h1>
                    <p class="text-left max-w-4xl">
                        To make it short: I'm just a teen who likes computers a lot<br>
                        I'll split the website into sections, so you'll still learn something about me without having to read the wall of text<br><br>

                        To make it long? Well...<br>
                        <span class="text-xl font-bold">I'm Cnnn666, or Dozy</span> for short. Although my real name is "Wojtek". As some might already guess, I come from a slavic country, Poland.<br>
                        I like coding things, mainly websites and games. My favourite projects are: <span class="font-bold">"Twitter" clone</span> and <span class="font-bold">Roman Clicker</span>.<br><br>

                        But that's obviously not it, I've created (or rather tried to) a minecraft mod that added a few items and blocks. There was also a project of a multi-purpose discord bot, but it's been dead for a long time.<br>
                        I've also helped a bit with polish translation for InfiniteChess.<br><br>
                        As an apprentice, I've created a website for a school in my city using Wordpress (alongside my friend), and created a website for an Airsoft club in my school with 2 other friends (custom PHP backend, and frontend). None of these are available on my github, and probably won't ever be.<br><br>

                        I think that's about it for the coding "about me" section. Let's move onto something else.<br>
                        Starting with: I'm currently 16 (very soon 17 :>) years old. If any of you wondered, my bday is on the 15th December. Oh, and I'm ace if you guys wanted to know that<br><br>

                        As you already know, I like programming, but what if I told you I like games as well?<br>
                        Some of my favourite <i>video</i> games are <span class="font-bold">Minecraft, Dying Light 1&2, Buckshot Roulette, Euro Truck Simulator 2.</span> Obviously these are not everything I play, just my favourites. Why?<br>
                        <span class="font-bold">Minecraft</span> - Sandbox game, pretty chill where I can be as creative as I want!<br>
                        <span class="font-bold">Dying Light 1&2</span> - Stories were absolute cinema (still playing through DL1 story, so no spoilers pls, but it's fire so far) and mechanics are also <span class="font-bold">REALLY</span> cool.<br>
                        <span class="font-bold">Buckshot Roulette</span> - The athomsphere, the sondtrack, the gameplay... it's all perfect. Story mode and multiplayer will make you think about the lore of the game and theorize about it... at least I did.<br>
                        <span class="font-bold">Euro Truck Simulator 2</span> - Chill game where you travel through the cities of Europe, pretty cool if you want to be left with just your own thoughts, or listen to some music while playing something.<br>
                        How could I forget about the STALKER and METRO games? Honestly, I dont know, but go play them all and you won't regret it :) easily my top games right after Minecraft.<br><br>

                        But enough of that, notice how I "italized" the word "video"? Yeah, video games are not the only games I like.<br>
                        In school we have a teacher, with who we sometimes play board games together! You don't believe me? Yeah, I also wouldn't belive myself if I didn't experience it.<br>
                        I do have to say though, that before we had classes with him I didn't like board games at all. But after all that I pretty much love them!<br><br>

                        That would be it for the "gaming" section, let's move onto something more interesting and important<br>
                        As you might know, I'm playing through Cyberpunk 2077, and that game basically tells us what will the world look like if we keep letting the big corpos rule us. We have to keep decentralizing the internet so that no Meta, no Google, no Microsoft can have full power over it. How do you decentralize it? Well, you host a game server on your own hardware instead of using Google services. You can use a Linux distro, instead of running a Windows machine. You can create some forums, instead of relying on Facebook groups.<br>
                        Ok, the point isn't for you to ditch 100% of those services, but the point is to limit how many of them you use, and try switching to alternatives if you can.<br>
                        We also have to keep fighting for our privacy. No company or government should control us 24/7 or know <i>everything</i> about us. We should have the right to encrypt our messages without the ability of the government to know the message content. One can say "think of the children!", but think about it. Do you really want your kid to be observed by a government or some company 24/7? Should the kid really have no privacy just to "make him safe"?<br><br>

                        I guess that's about it? Well, have fun checking my website and take this üç™ cookie if you've read it all :)
